<h2 align=center>Hello, welcome to my Github! 👋 </h2>
<h3 align=center>Pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton. </h3>

I'm a 4th year student with a passion for full stack development. I enjoy programming in my free time and am hoping to expand my porfolio. Beyond coding, I'm a huge **space enthusiast**. Interstellar is my favorite movie, and I'm always fascinated by space exploration. Looking forward to collaborate! 🚀
