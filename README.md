<h2 align=center>Hello, welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹ </h2>
<h3 align=center>Pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton. </h3>

I'm a 4th year student with a passion for full stack development. I enjoy programming in my free time and am hoping to expand my porfolio. Beyond coding, I'm a huge **space enthusiast**. Interstellar is my favorite movie, and I'm always fascinated by space exploration and anything to aliens! I like to exercise, eat delicious foods, and travel with my family. Looking forward to collaborate with you all! ðŸš€
